Benchmark Scripts README
========================

This folder contains scripts for benchmarking dlvhex.

The following files are provided:
(for details about their parameters call them without arguments to
 get help output)

(1) runinsts.sh
    Implements a loop over instances and schedules them for execution.
    This is done either sequentially or in parallel using Condor HT.
    The parameters of the script control the loop condition
    and the command used for executing a single instance.
    This script will also call aggregate.sh after execution of all instance
    to produce the final benchmark table.

(2) run_template.sh (example for an implementation of run.sh)
    Executes a single instance under various configurations.
    The parameters are retrieved from runinsts.sh and specify
    the current instance name and the timeout.

(3) runconfs.sh
    A helper script for the implementation of (2) for executing
    a single instance under various configurations.
    The parameters control the configurations to be compared
    and the name of an output builder.

(4) timeoutbuilder.sh and sgtimeoutbuilder.sh
    Create the final (benchmark-relevant) output from the result
    of an instance execution.
    timeoutbuilder.sh extracts just the overall time, while
    sgtimeoutbuilder.sh extracts the overall time, the grounding and the solving time.

(5) aggregateresults.sh
    Generates the final output of a benchmark as a table.

For convenience, the run.sh script in (2) might not only be used to
execute a single instance, but also as a wrapper for the overall workflow.
Then (2) can be directly called by the used, which delegates the call to (1)
and specifies appropriate parameters (this will result in back-calls of (2) for single instances).
The run.sh script can distinct via its first parameter (all or single) whether it is called
for single instances or for the whole benchmark.


The typical workflow is as follows:
                                                          ---------------------------------------------------------------------> aggregateresults.sh ------> table.dat
                                                          |
          User ---(all)---> (2) ./run.sh ------> (1) runinsts.sh ------> (3) runconfs.sh ------> (4) outputbuilder.sh
                                   ^                                                                       |
                                   |                                                                       |
                                   ---------------------------------(single)--------------------------------
