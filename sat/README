This is a plugin for solving SAT instances given in DIMACS format.

There are two modes:
* sat -> use x v nx for each variable, add constraint for each clause
  returns all witnesses if satisfiable
	returns no answer set if unsatisfiable
* unsat -> use saturation encoding from Wolfgang Faber, LPNMR 2005, "Unfounded Sets ..."
	returns no answer set if satisfiable
  returns one witness (spoiled answer set) if unsatisfiable

This plugin is just for benchmarking.
(Of course we could simply use a SAT-solver to solve SAT instances.)
